# Web-Based-Claim-Processing-System
To overcome problems like manual application forms may miss during transits;  form is prone to weariness due to which the company may not be able to read data in it  after some years. The employees who claimed for medical reimbursement need to visit  the Cash Counter (CC) from time to time enquiring about the status of their application.  This results in enormous wastage of time of the employee. It is proposed to develop  software titled “Web Based Claims Processing System (WCPS)” which is web based  so that the employee can fill the form online and submit it so that the form is sent to  Claim Processing System (CPD) through Internet. At CPD, the form needs to be checked  automatically by a program which will compute the amount that needs to be reimbursed  to the employee for the treatment undertaken.
